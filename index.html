              The Schmidt AI for Science program at the University of Toronto
              will host a three-day workshop in Toronto exploring how AI
              foundation models can solve interdisciplinary scientific problems.
              A foundation model is a general-purpose AI/ML model that has
              already learned information suitable for diverse tasks;
              state-of-the-art results show that a foundation model trained with
              data from one scientific domain (e.g., astronomy) may be suitable
              for problems in another scientific domain (e.g., chemistry). This
              workshop combines lectures with hands-on tutorials and culminates
              in a hackathon.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the hackathon, attendees will form teams that test and utilize
              foundation models for science; teams will compete for prizes in
              categories such as innovative solutions, best team spirit, and
              most robust model. All local expenses, including four nights'
              accommodation, transportation, and meals, will be covered by the
              organizers. Attendees will be responsible for funding their travel
              to and from Toronto, along with any extra days outside of the
              workshop days.
            </p>
            <p>
              Participants are expected to attend the full three-day program
              (approximately 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM daily) and actively contribute
              to the hackathon. Participants will also attend social events
              organized outside of workshop hours.

                We are seeking approximately 50 participants with diverse
                scientific backgrounds who are interested in learning and
                applying cross-domain AI solutions. Researchers who plan to or
                currently use foundation models to unlock new insights in
                scientific research are particularly encouraged to apply.
                Proficiency in Python and at least one deep learning framework
                (PyTorch, TensorFlow, or JAX) is expected, though various levels
                of familiarity with foundation models are welcome, as tutorials
                will accommodate different skill levels.
              </p>
              <p>
                First-year fellows interested in foundation models are
                especially encouraged to attend. Ideal candidates will possess
                technical programming abilities, domain-specific knowledge and
                an interest in working on scientific use cases that may not
                directly relate to their current research.
